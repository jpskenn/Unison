# MX_Alps_Hybrid.pretty
KiCad Library of custom MX-Alps footprints

![Footprint Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid.pretty/master/Screenshots/Footprint.png)  

### Variants

##### Prefixes
* ALPS-* - Alps SKCM/SKCL only.
* MX-* - MX/Alps Hybrids.
* MXOnly-* - Cherry MX only.

##### Suffixes
* FLIPPED - Reversed LED pads for overlapping switch footprints.
* NoLED - No LED pads.
* ReversedStabilizers - Stabilizer mirrored vertically (i.e. for bottom row).
* LED - Specifically for Alps, has a 1206 reverse mount position. Probably useless since not many people use Matias switches anyways.
* Hotswap - A beta footprint. Kailh Hotswap, but modified to be resistant to being ripped off the PCB.

### Features
 * Designed from scratch using official datasheets and accurate measurements
 * Various footprints for all occasions
 * Almost every switch size in existence
 * Topside soldermask to prevent solder overflow and improve appearance

### Request More Footprints
I'll be more than happy to make more custom footprints to fit your needs, time permitting.
Simply contact me via Discord @ai03#2725, or twitter @ai03_2725.

### Contributing
Feel free to create pull requests with more footprints. I only ask that they are of high quality, and that they are based on official dimensions, if possible.
